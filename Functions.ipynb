        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        " - A function is a block of reusable code that is not bound to any object.\n",
        "\n",
        " - A method is a function that is associated with an object and is called using dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        " - Parameters are the variables listed in a function’s definition.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        " - Functions can be defined using the def keyword or using lambda for anonymous functions.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Functions are called by using their name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
        " - The return statement is used to exit a function and send back a result to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " - An iterator is an object with a __next__() method that returns items one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        " - An iterable is an object that can be passed to iter() to create an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        " - Generators are a type of iterable, defined using functions with the yield keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        " - They return one item at a time and maintain their state between iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        " - Generators are more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        " - They support lazy evaluation, producing items only when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        " - A lambda function is an anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        " - It is typically used for short, simple functions passed as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        " - The map() function applies a specified function to each item of an iterable and returns a map object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
        " - map(): Applies a function to all elements in an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        " - reduce(): Applies a rolling computation to items of an iterable to reduce it to a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        " - filter(): Filters elements based on a function that returns True or False.\n",
